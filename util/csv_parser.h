     * Quotation marks are considered doubled even in unquoted field e.g. test1""test2 -> test1"test2 and test1"test2 -> test1"test2.
     * No header is expected, data fields are expected in the fist line of CSV data.
     * Expected newline is LF, CR or CRLF.
     * Accept and ignores empty lines except one optional newline at the end of data, that do not create row in output.
     * Don't care about number of fields in row.
